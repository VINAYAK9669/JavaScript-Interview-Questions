## 1. What is JavaScript?

### Definition

            - JavaScript is a `single-threaded`, `asynchronous` programming language.
            - In practical terms, this means that JavaScript primarily executes code in a linear, step-by-step fashion with a `single thread`.
            - However, it excels in handling asynchronous tasks by employing an event-driven, non-blocking model.
            - This allows JavaScript to efficiently manage operations concurrently, making it well-suited for creating responsive and interactive web applications.

#### i) `Interpreted` Programming Language.

            - `Interpreted`: In such a programming langauge source code is  executed line by line or statement by statement by an interpreter, rather than being compiled into machine code before execution.
            - Because of this nature it offers ease of debugging, tends to have a slower execution, often features dynamic typing
            - Example: JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and PHP

#### ii) `single-threaded`, `asynchronous`

            - This means that it processes `one` task at a time (single-threaded).
            - Tasks are initiated but may not complete immediately.
            - Instead of waiting for a task to finish before moving on to the next one, 
              asynchronous programming allows a program to continue processing other tasks while waiting for the completion of certain operations.
